# PopulaPy
Python (numpy/scipy/pandas/matplotlib) based Visualization tool for population structure data as generated with Illumina SNP chips. 

The code is currently still in a very raw state. The Python scripts are supposed to be used as examplary.
The plan is to have more documentation on the command line level.
